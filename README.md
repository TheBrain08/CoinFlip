# CoinFlip

CoinFlip is a web application that simulates flipping a coin. When the user clicks the "Flip" button, the application randomly selects either the front or back of a coin image and plays a sound to mimic the sound of a coin flip.

## Usage

To use CoinFlip, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the "Flip" button to flip the coin. The application will randomly display either the front or back of the coin image and play a sound.
